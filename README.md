# Digital_logic_simulator_3D
An application for planning and simulating digital logic circuits in 3D space
(This projects was first created and "finished" in 2017, This is a vastly improved version that will continue to be updated and maintained)

This project was implemented using:
  C++
  Vulkan
  glfw
  glm
  stb_image
  tiny_obj_loader
  tinyxml2

Features:
  tools to build digital logic circuits
  ability to simulate these circuits
  saving and loading functionality using XML
